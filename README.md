# Introduction

This repository contains an [Azure DevOps Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and a [GitHub Workflow Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps). See below usage examples to start using this in your CI. 

These are the minimal checks we run on our own PRs for [SwiftKey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey), however we're happy to accept contributions. See [contributing section](#contributing) below if you would like to expand this action's features.

## Usage examples

- In a Azure DevOps Pipeline

   ```yml
    - task: android-app-size-diff@0
      inputs:
        baseAppPath: test/assets/test.apk
        targetAppPath: test/assets/test.apk
        summaryOutputPath: summary.md
      displayName: Run APK size comparision
   ```
   
- In a GitHub Workflow

   ```yml
     - uses: microsoft/android-app-size-diff@v0.32
       name: Run APK size comparision
       with:
        baseAppPath: test/assets/test.apk
        targetAppPath: test/assets/test.apk
        summaryOutputPath: summary.md
   ```

## Usage API
The API to use the GitHub action or Azure DevOps task is similar

### Inputs

- `baseAppPath`: Path to base apk. This is the app before changes
  - required: true
  - default: 'base.apk'
- `baseAppLabel`: Label to use for the base app in the report
  - required: false
  - default: 'Base APK'
- `targetAppPath`: Path to target apk. This is the app after changes
  - required: true
  - default: 'target.apk'
- `targetAppLabel`: Label to use for the base app in the report
  - required: false
  - default: 'Target APK'
- `summaryOutputPath`: Output file where comparision summary should be written to
  - required: true
  - default: 'summary.md'
- `metrics`: A comma seperated list of size metrics to include in the summary. Possible values are `apkSize`, `installSize`, `dexFiles`, `arscFile`, `nativeLibs`
  - required: false
  - default: 'apkSize, installSize, dexFiles, arscFile, nativeLibs'
- `thresholds`: A comma seperated list of thresholds for each of the metrics in bytes. If this is empty, no thresholding will apply. When this is not empty, the task will fail when any of the given thresholds are crossed
  - required: false
  - default: ''
- `telemetryEnabled`: Set to `false` to disable telemetry
  - required: false
  - default: 'true'

## Setting up development

Starting by cloning the repository. If your changes are small, feel free to open a PR with changes and the CI will take care of testing that everything still works with your changes. For something more long term or local testing, read on.

### Installations
- Install all global dependencies
  ```shell
  npm install -g typescript
  npm install -g ts-node
  npm install -g mocha
  
  # Only if you are compiling the GitHub plugin
  npm install -g @zeit/ncc
  
  # Only if you are publishing to ADO. Not required for most scenarios
  npm install -g tfx-cli
  ```
- Install all project dependencies
  `npm install`   
  
### Running 

See `package.json` for full list of npm tasks. The below should be sufficient to get you started

- Build code `npm run build`
- Run ADO plugin locally `npm run adoTask`
  - See [ADO Custom Task docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task?view=azure-devops#run-the-task) to understand what variables to set - basically all task inputs
- Run all tests `npm run test`
  - Likely a better way to test your changes
- Bundle all plugins `npm run bundle`
